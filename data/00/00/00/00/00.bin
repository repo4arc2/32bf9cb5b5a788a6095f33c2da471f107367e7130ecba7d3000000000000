里面还有人
There were people in there.

11
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,440
跟这些人只能用暴力沟通

她在给流离失所的人提供庇护和药物
She's giving displaced people shelter and medicine.

14
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,440
那是能够培养忠诚的
That kinda thing creates loyalty, man.

15
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,560
我们真的已经用尽一切办法了
We've literally tried everything we can.

16
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,360
那我们就把注压在牌更好的人身上
So we bet on someone with a better hand.

17
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,530
有人重制了超级士兵血清
Someone recreated the super-soldier serum.

18
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,390
你认为这跟九头蛇有关
You are assuming HYDRA has something to do with this,

19
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,830
所以才来找我
which is why you came to me.

20
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,170
你走运了  我知道从哪查起
Luckily, for you, I know where to begin.

21
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,320
放下枪  泽莫
Drop it, Zemo.

莎伦
Sharon?

23
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,180
卡莉·摩根索还有至少另外七人注射了血清
Karli Morgenthau and at least seven others have taken the serum.

24
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,450
我们查到了一个名字  威尔弗雷德·内格尔
We got a name. Wilfred Nagel.

25
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,840
-你做了多少支  -20支
- How many vials did you make? - Twenty.

26
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,190
卡莉现在在哪
Where's Karli now?

27
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,950
几天前
A couple of days ago,

28
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,080
她打来问我能不能帮一个叫唐妮娅·迈丹尼的人
she called and asked if I could help someone named Donya Madani.

29
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,340
对不起
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,660
她死在里加  一个靠近波罗的海的城市
She died in Riga, a city near the Baltic Sea.

31
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,270
我们有个地方可以去
I have a place we can go.

32
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,850
我要去散散步
I'm gonna go on a walk.

33
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,420
我还在想你什么时候会出现
I was wondering when you were gonna show up.

34
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,900

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,810
你确定吗
You sure about this?

39
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,870
我不会让你伤到人的
I won't let you hurt anyone.

你自由了
You are free.

53
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,190
你怎么能放了他
How could you free him?

54
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,840
我们需要他帮忙
We need his help.

55
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,470
时间  意志和资源的投入
With time, will, and the resources,

56
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,730
清除了你的冬兵洗脑
the Winter Soldier programming

57
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,120
就像挖掉腐烂的毛皮
was removed from you like a rotten fur.

58
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,860
对此我很感谢
And I'm grateful for that.

59
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,940
我感激你和苏睿做的一切
I'm grateful for everything you and Shuri have done...

60
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,470
泽莫在联合国杀了我们的特查卡国王
Zemo murdered our King T'Chaka at the U.N.

61
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,680
他选了我们
The man who chose us.

62
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,280
选了我  来保护他
Who chose me to protect him.

63
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,350
我理解
I understand.

64
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,510
我们的损失和羞愧  你即便了解
Very little, if anything, 

65
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,420
也远不够深刻
of our loss and our shame.

66
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,500
{\an2}他是达到目的的手段

67
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,790
八小时  白狼
Eight hours, White Wolf.

68
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,020
然后我们就来抓他
Then we come for him.

69
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,230
{\an8}猎鹰与冬兵
第一季  第四集

70
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,230
瓦坎达人来了  他们要泽莫
Well, the Wakandans are here. They want Zemo.

71
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,760
我给我们争取到了点时间
Bought us some more time.

72
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,560
-你被跟踪了吗  -没有
- Were you followed? - No.

73
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,260
你怎么能确定
How can you be so sure?

74
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,170
因为我被跟踪的话  我肯定会发现
'Cause I know when I'm being followed.

75
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,590
至少  多谢你维护我了
It was sweet of you to defend me at least.

76
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,900
你闭嘴  没谁要维护你
Hey, you shut it. No one's defending you.

77
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,330
你杀了内格尔
You killed Nagel.

78
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,620
我们非要纠结于可能发生了或没发生什么吗
Do we really have to litigate what may or may not have happened?

79
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,180
这有什么可纠结的  你直接开枪杀了个人
There's nothing to litigate. You straight shot the man.

80
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,280
-山姆  -怎么了
- Sam. - What?

81
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,340
卡莉炸了个全球回归委员会供给站
Karli bombed a GRC supply depot. 

82
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,350
什么  损失多严重
What? What's the damage?

83
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,290
十一人受伤  三人死亡
Eleven injured, three dead.

84
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,260
他们列出了要求
They have a list of demands

85
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,370
还说如果得不到满足会再次发动袭击
and are promising more attacks if those demands aren't met.

86
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,980
她越来越疯狂了
She's getting worse.

87
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,960
我有决心完成任务
I have the will to complete this mission.

88
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,130
你们有吗
Do the two of you?

89
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,590
她只是个孩子
She's just a kid.

90
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,120
你在她身上看到了不存在的东西
You're seeing something in her that isn't there.

91
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,890
而且你受此影响
You're clouded by it.

92
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,930
她是个至上主义者
She's a supremacist.

93
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,750
超级士兵的概念永远都会让人不安
The very concept of a Super Soldier will always trouble people.

94
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,780
正是这种扭曲的抱负塑造了纳粹
It's that warped aspiration that led to Nazis,

95
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,650
奥创  复仇者
to Ultron, to the Avengers.

96
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,160
你说的可是我们的朋友
Those are our friends you're talking about. 

97
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,580
他是指复仇者  不是纳粹
The Avengers, not the Nazis.

98
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,190
卡莉太极端了
So, Karli is radicalized,

99
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,410
但肯定还有和平的阻止她的方式
but there has to be a peaceful way to stop her.

100
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,410
成为超级人类的欲望
The desire to become a superhuman

101
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,400
是与至上主义理念密不可分的
cannot be separated from supremacist ideals.

102
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,880
任何有那种血清的人  必然会走上那条路
Anyone with that serum is inherently on that path.

103
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,600
她不会停下  她只会升级  除非你杀了她
She will not stop. She will escalate until you kill her.

104
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,960
或她杀了你
Or she kills you.

105
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,690
或许你错了呢  泽莫
Maybe you're wrong, Zemo.

106
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,720
血清就没腐化史蒂夫
The serum never corrupted Steve.

107
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,870
说得太对了
Touché.

108
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,170
但就再没有第二个史蒂夫·罗杰斯了  是吧
But there has never been another Steve Rogers, has there?

109
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,410
或许我们该这就把他交给瓦坎达人
Well, maybe we should give him to the Wakandans right now.

110
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,910
-你要放弃你的导游吗  -嗯
- And you'll give up your tour guide? - Yes.

111
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,330
据我了解
From my understanding,

112
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,620
唐妮娅算是社区支柱那样的人物  是吧
Donya is like a pillar of the community, right?

113
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,910
我小时候  我的TT过世了
So, when I was a kid, my TT passed away.

114
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,610
你的TT
Your TT?

115
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,350
对  我的TT
Yeah, my TT, yeah.

116
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,750
你的TT是谁
Who is your TT?

117
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,240
好吧  我小时候  我姑妈过世了
Fine. When I was a kid, my aunt passed away

118
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,060
整个社区都凑在一起  悼念她
and the entire neighborhood got together for a ceremony.

119
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,540
持续了一周
It was like a week long.

120
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,580
或许他们也在为唐妮娅这么做
Maybe they're doing the same thing for Donya.

121
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,070
值得一试
Worth a shot.

122
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,380
你的TT会为你骄傲的
Your TT would be proud of you.

123
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,780
土耳其软糖
Turkish delight.

124
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,010
无法抗拒
Irresistible.

125
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,670
被炸毁的站点
The depot that was bombed

126
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,870
是由全球回归委员会
was funded and run by the GRC,

127
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,220
成立运作的
the Global Repatriation Council.

128
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,040
其中一名遇难工人  有两个孩子
One of the workers killed was the father of two

129
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,600
才入职一周
and had only been on the job for one week.

130
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,320
谴责了极端组织
After condemning this latest action

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,720
{\an8}全球回归委员会站点被炸

132
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,900
碎旗者这一最新举动后
by theradical group known as the Flag Smashers,

133
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,210
全球回归委员会正式开始
the GRC formally began

134
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,920
起草所谓的《补丁法》
drafting legislation known as The Patch Act,

135
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,780
力求恢复传统边境管理条例
which would seek to restore traditional border regulations

136
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,360
尽快恢复正常生活
and fast-track the return to normalcy.

137
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,300
暴力举动也引起了人们对碎旗者的关注
The act of violence has also brought attention

138
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,870
给他们带来了更多追随者
and followers to the Flag Smasher cause.

139
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,130
没人能否认该组织的世界影响力在上升
No one can deny the world-wide reach of this group is growing,

140
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,800
其危险性也在变大
as is the danger.

141
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,000
这地方的沦落真是可惜
Shame what's become of this place.

142
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,880
我小时候  我们会来这里
When I was young, we used to come here

143
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,730
吃美味的晚饭  参加华丽的聚会
for fabulous dinners and parties.

144
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,500
我当时对政治当然一窍不通
I knew nothing of the politics of the time, of course,

145
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,730
但我记得它的美丽
but I remember it being beautiful.

146
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,260
{\an8}重启  恢复  重建

147
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,540
我去楼上到处看看
I'm gonna take a look around upstairs.

148
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,510
你在这里打听一下
See what you can find out here.

149
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,580
盯住他
And keep an eye on him.

150
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,590
我不给你碍事
I'll stay out of your way.

151
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,050
小子
Hey, kid.

152
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,900
不好意思
Excuse me.

153
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,740
你知道唐妮娅·迈丹尼吗
You heard of Donya Madani?

154
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,500
不
No.

155
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,340
抱歉  不
Sorry, no.

156
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,310
唐妮娅·迈丹尼
Donya Madani?

157
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,670
等等
Hey, wait.

158
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,320
该死
Shit!

159
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,440
唐妮娅
Donya?

160
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,340
不知道吗
No?

161
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,490
你最喜欢什么颜色
And what's your favorite color?

162
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,120
黄色吗
Yellow?

163
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,830
会拼吗
Can you spell it?

164
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,330
不好意思
Excuse me.

165
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,330
你知道一个叫唐妮娅·迈丹尼的女人吗
Do you know a woman by the name of Donya Madani?

166
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,120
她曾是这里的难民
She was a refugee here.

167
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,830
我们不是难民  我们不需要寻求避难
We're not refugees, for we have nothing to seek refuge from.

168
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,160
不管怎样  我们是国际流离失所者
We're internationally-displaced persons, for what it's worth,

169
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,300
我们不信任外人
and we don't trust outsiders.

170
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,320
我理解
No, I understand.

171
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,730
我不是这里人
I'm not from here, but 

172
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,050
但我很擅长帮忙
I have a pretty good track record of helping out.

173
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,550
我知道人们说要帮忙时会发生什么
I know what happens when people say they're going to help out.

174
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,780
什么都不会发生
Nothing.

175
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,840
全球回归委员会
The Global Repatriation Council

176
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,210
答应给我们再多派一些老师  送来补给
promised to send more teachers, supplies.

177
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,390
他们光说不做都已经六个月了
That was six months ago.

178
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,590
-你叫什么  我打个电话试试  -我知道你是谁
- What's your name? Maybe I can make a call. - I know who you are.

179
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,390
但我不能相信你
But I can't trust you.

180
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,820
抱歉  我们走吧
I'm sorry. Let's go.

181
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,120
*咩咩黑羊  你有羊毛吗*
* Baa, Baa, black sheep, have you any wool? *

182
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,490
*有的有的  满满三袋子*
* Yes, sir, yes, sir, three bags full *

183
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,290
*一袋给我家老爷  一袋给贵妇人*
* One for my master, one for the dame *

184
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,940
*一袋给住在巷子那头的小姑娘*
 *One for the little girl who lives down the lane *

185
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,820
土耳其软糖
Turkish delight.

186
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,930
我儿子生前一直最喜欢吃
It was always my son's favorite.

187
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,590
我的老朋友唐妮娅去世了
My old friend, Donya, passed away.

188
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,480
你认识她吗
Did you know her?

189
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,360
认识
Yes.

190
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,510
我是来送她最后一程的
I would like to pay my last respects.

191
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,300
你知道她的葬礼在哪里办吗
Do you know where her funeral will be?

192
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,640
我开始感觉是一条死胡同
It's starting to feel like a dead end.

193
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,120
他在干什么
The hell is he doing?

194
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,740
你看见那两个男人了吗
Do you see these men there?

195
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,970
他们坏透了  不能相信他们
They're very bad. Not to be trusted.

196
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,750
唐妮娅是我们的小秘密  明白吗
Donya is our little secret, okay?

197
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,140
看起来很好吃  我要一颗
Those look good. I want one.

198
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,930
可爱的孩子们
Cute kids.

199
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,100
我没任何发现
Well, I got nothin'.

200
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,770
没人谈论唐妮娅
No one's talkin' about Donya.

201
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,030
是啊  因为只有卡莉一个人为他们斗争
Yeah, it's because Karli is the only one fighting for them.

202
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,680
而且她没做错
And she's not wrong.

203
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,020
你什么意思
What do you mean?

204
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,290
五年来
For five years,

205
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,400
人们被欢迎进入
people have been welcomed into countries

206
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,800
那些曾经用铁丝网将他们拒之门外的国家
that have kept them out using barbwire.

207
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,200
新组成了那么多家庭  找到了那么多新工作
There were houses and jobs.

208
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,760
人们很高兴有人帮助他们重建
Folks were happy to have people around to help them rebuild.

209
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,930
不止是一个社区聚在一起
It wasn't just one community coming together,

210
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,440
而是全世界聚在一起
it was the entire world coming together.

211
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,000
然后  砰的一声
And then, boom.

212
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,440
就是这么突然  世界一下就回到了以前的样子
Just like that, it goes right back to the way it used to be.

213
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,570
对他们来说  至少卡莉有所行动
To them, at least Karli's doin' somethin'.

214
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,990
你真认为  她目的高尚就等于手段合理吗
You really think her ends justify her means?

215
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,980
那么她跟他  跟我们抗击过的其他人也没区别了
Then, she's no different than him or anybody else we've fought.

216
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,450
她不一样
She's different.

217
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,980
她的动机不一样
She's not motivated by the same things.

218
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,350
那个小女孩
That little girl.

219
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,260
她跟你说什么了
What'd she tell you?

220
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,670
葬礼今天下午举行
The funeral is this afternoon.

221
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,790
你知道女子皇家护卫队随时都会来杀你
You know the Dora's coming for you any minute.

222
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,320
其实她们现在可能就在外面潜伏着
In fact, they're probably lurking outside right now.

223
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:07,940
你继续说
Keep talking.

224
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,000
等着找到卡莉之后  你们把我交出去吗
Leaving you to turn on me once we get to Karli.

225
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,580
我还是给自己留筹码吧
I prefer to keep my leverage.

226
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,640
你想见识下某人能对筹码做什么吗
You wanna see what someone can do with leverage?

227
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,020
放轻松  别跟他说话
Take it easy. Don't engage him.

228
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,980
他只会勒索你  歪着头装逼
He's just gonna extort you and do that stupid head tilt thing.

229
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,060
我去打个电话
Let me make a call.

230
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,700
你想喝樱花茶吗
You want some cherry blossom tea?

231
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,170
不了  你喝吧
No, you go ahead.

232
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,400
虽然听到朋友的声音很开心
Well, as nice as it is to hear a friendly voice,

233
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,950
但我不由得感觉有人要开口求我帮忙了
I can't help but feel a favor comin' on.

234
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,190
我们找到那个安置营了
We found the camp.

235
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,140
但这里没人肯开口
But no one here is tellin' us shit.

236
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,690
泽莫查出今天晚些时候就要办葬礼了
Zemo found out the funeral's later today,

237
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,990
但他用情报吊着我们
but he's holdin' us hostage with the information.

238
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,930
他这么干你还惊讶吗
And that surprises you?

239
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,450
所以你不想盲目下场
So, you don't wanna go into this blind.

240
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,850
莎伦  听着  我知道我已经欠你情了
Sharon, listen, I know I owe you already,

241
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,240
但如果能有值得信赖的眼睛盯着安置营就好了
but we could use a trustworthy set of eyes on the camp.

242
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,770
你还有什么魔法吗
You got any more tricks in your bag?

243
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,010
我也许可以使用一两颗卫星  也可能不行
I may or may not have access to a satellite or two.

244
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,660
我看看我能做什么吧
Let me see what I can do.

245
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,450
谢谢
Thank you.

246
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,480
山姆  你得让这件事彻底了结
Hey, Sam, you gotta play this out.

247
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,030
如果卡莉消失了
If Karli disappears,

248
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,570
我们就没法及时找到那些血清了
we're not gonna find that serum until it's too late.

249
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,410
我知道
I know.

250
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,650
权力掮客听说了内格尔的事后勃然大怒
The Power Broker went apeshit when he heard about Nagel.

251
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,450
他想把血清找回来
He wants the serum back.

252
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,580
你杀了他的摇钱树
You killed the golden goose.

253
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,100
马德里坡要变得非常难对付了
Madripoor's about to get real nasty.

254
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,780
抱歉
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,830
不必道歉  赶紧找到卡莉吧
Don't apologize. Just find Karli.

256
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:14,030
你觉得我错了吗  想创造更多我们这样的人
Do you think I'm makin' a mistake making more of us?

257
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,610
我祖父卢卡斯  曾是二战时期的一名地下军
My grandfather, Lukasz, he was a World War II resistance fighter.

258
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:24,220
{\an8}卢卡斯·科瓦斯克

259
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,460
他以前总对我说
He always used to tell me,

260
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,390
"如果你做的事情令你感到恐惧
"If you're doing somethin', and it makes you scared,

261
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,410
也许那正是正确的事"
"It's probably because it's the right thing."

262
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,300
而且他是与纳粹作斗争的人
And he fought Nazis, so...

263
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,090
听上去像是个好建议
Seems like good advice.

264
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,710
你知道吗  我小时候其实是美国队长的粉丝
You know, when I was a kid, I was actually a Captain America fan.

265
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,280
我不知道要不要拿这件事取笑你
I don't know if I should tease you about that yet or not.

266
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,520
是他让我相信这个世界上还是有正派人的
He made me believe that there was decent people in this world.

267
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,440
直到遇到你之前
I didn't think there could be

268
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,940
我都不相信还会再有下一个美国队长了
another Captain America until I met you.

269
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,080
在过去  世界非黑即白
You know, back then, there was just good and bad,

270
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,690
但现在世界更为复杂了  人们都迷失了
but the world's more complicated now. People are lost.

271
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,620
他们需要一个和他们是同类人
They need a leader who looks like them,

272
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,380
并且能够理解他们痛苦的领袖
who understands their pain.

273
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,490
这个领袖能够明白  如今的英雄们
Someone who understands that today's heroes

274
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,860
已不能奢求双手不染鲜血
don't have the luxury of keeping their hands clean.

275
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,700
我们的大业会比那面盾牌的传承更长久
What we're doing will outlive the legacy of that shield.

276
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,700
那面盾牌是一个逝去时代的纪念碑
That shield is a monument to a bygone era.

277
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,590
让人们记住历史上被遗忘的那些人
A reminder of all the people history just left out.

278
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,160
其实那面盾牌应该被毁掉
If anything, that shield should be destroyed.

279
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,520
这些血清能够帮我们改变这一切
This serum is how we make change.

280
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,130
但是首先我们得去送别唐妮娅老师
But first, we pay our respects to Mama Donya.

281
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,690
卡莉·摩根索太危险了
Karli Morgenthau is too dangerous

282
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,210
你们不该这么做
for you guys to be pulling this shit.

283
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,150
这次又是怎么找到我们的
How'd you find us now?

284
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,720
得了吧  你觉得两名复仇者
Come on. You think two Avengers

285
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,630
能在拉脱维亚乱逛而不引人注意吗
can walk around Latvia without drawing attention?

286
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,140
不要再瞒着我们擅自行动了
No more keeping us in the dark.

287
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,800
先告诉我们为什么要帮他越狱
You could start by telling us why you broke him out of prison.

288
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,280
严格来说  是他自己越狱的
He did that himself, technically.

289
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,230
这个解释最好很有说服力
This better be an unbelievable explana...

290
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,650
放轻松  别闹大了
Hey, take it easy before it gets weird.

291
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,930
我知道卡莉在哪里
I know where Karli is.

292
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:01,040
-在哪  -我们只知道是个悼念仪式
- Well, where? - All we know is, it's a memorial.

293
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,770
所以我们打算过去拦截她
So, we're gonna intercept her there.

294
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,790
那意味着有很多平民  太容易造成伤亡了
That means civilians. High risk of casualties.

295
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,410
那好吧  我们快速潜入  打她个出其不意
All right, good, we'll move in fast. Take her by surprise.

296
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,190
不行  我要和她单独谈谈
No, I wanna talk to her alone.

297
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,940
我不能再跟丢她了
I'm not losing her again.

298
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,250
她最亲近的人死了  她非常脆弱
Look, the person closest to her died, she's vulnerable.

299
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,380
现在是最好的劝服她的时机
Now is the best time to reason with her.

300
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,750
什么  不行  停下  听我说行吗
What? No. Wait, no! No! Stop. Hold on. Stop, okay?

301
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,280
我觉得我们早过了和她讲理的阶段了
I think we're way past reasoning with her,

302
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,340
除非你已经忘了
unless you forgot that

303
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,670
她炸掉了一栋有人的大楼
she blew up a building with people still in it.

304
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,510
山姆  你要是赤手空拳进去  她会杀了你的
Sam, you walk in there cold, she could kill you.

305
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,190
如果我武装好但行动失败了  会死更多人
If I go in hot and the op goes wrong, more people will die.

306
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,650
你任由他这么做吗
You'll let him do this?

307
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,900
你就任由你的搭档
Are you gonna let your partner

308
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,120
和一个超级士兵独处吗
walk into a room with a Super Soldier alone?

309
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,490
他见过更可怕的场面  还有他不是我搭档
He's dealt with worse. And he's not my partner.

310
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,010
我以前给战后创伤的士兵进行过心理疏导
I used to counsel soldiers dealing with trauma, okay?

311
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,860
-这是我的专长  -我知道
- This is in my wheelhouse. - I know.

312
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,100
而且我了解那些士兵
And I know those soldiers,

313
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
所以我才知道这是个坏主意
which is why I know this is a bad idea.

314
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,260
等一下  约翰
Wait, John.

315
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,550
如果他真能劝服她  也许值得一试
If he can talk her down, it might be worth a try.

316
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,120
我们过后再来处理你
We'll deal with you later.

317
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,940
我相信我们一定会达成共识的
I'm sure it will all come to an agreeable conclusion.

318
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,540
我的伙伴就在前面
My associate is just up ahead.

319
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,690
你好  我的朋友
Hello, my friend.

320
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,680
这是给你家人的
This is for your family.

321
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,040
你能带路吗
Can you show us the way?

322
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,950
搞什么
What the hell?

323
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,050
卡莉在里面
Karli's in there.

324
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,260
好
All right.

325
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,120
-给你十分钟  -认真的吗
- You got ten minutes. - Really?

326
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,930
然后就按照我的方式来
Then we're doing things my way.

327
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,550
很强硬
Aggressive.

328
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,350
但我能理解
But I get it.

329
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,090
我已经不记得我父母了
I don't remember my mother or my father.

330
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,380
也不记得什么兄弟姐妹  祖父祖母了
Same goes for siblings, grandparents, cousins.

331
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,540
我只记得孤身一人
What I do remember is bein' alone.

332
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,720
那种感觉比挨饿受冻恐慌都要可怕
Worse than bein' hungry or cold or scared.

333
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,990
我一直是一个人
I was alone.

334
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,490
直到遇到了唐妮娅老师
Until Mama Donya.

335
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,160
唐妮娅老师拯救了我  像拯救你们很多人一样
Like a lot of you here, Mama Donya saved me.

336
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:39,030
她给我吃穿  给我爱
She clothed me, fed me, loved me.

337
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,380
她教我我们要互相照应
She taught me that we have to do for each other

338
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,340
因为他们不会管我们
because they won't.

339
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,590
我们知道他们是谁
And we know who they are.

340
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,450
他们让我们受尽苦难和折磨
They imposed struggle and hardship on us,

341
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,990
然后因为我们的反抗而称我们为罪犯
then labeled us as criminals for pushing back.

342
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,690
但正是这种反抗才让我们凝聚在一起
But the struggle is what brings us all together.

343
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,580
我们这群原本毫不相关的人
People who have nothin' in common.

344
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,520
因为我们都是同一世界的同一类人
For we are, after all, simply one world and one people.

345
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,650
那就这样活下去
So live accordingly.

346
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,680
我刚刚看到你了
I saw you back there.

347
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,530
我是一个人来的
I came alone.

348
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,160
我只想聊聊
I just wanna talk.

349
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,780
你胆子很大
Bold of you.

350
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,870
节哀顺变
I'm sorry for your loss.

351
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,100
别哄我  我不是小孩
Don't condescend to me. I'm not a child.

352
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,680
我没有  我知道失去一个人的感受
I'm not. I know what it's like to lose someone.

353
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,490
-相信我  -不  你不知道这种感受
- Believe me. - No, you don't. Not like this.

354
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,480
没有必要演变成战争的  卡莉
It doesn't have to be a war, Karli.

355
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,150
他们把我们踢出我们的新家
They started a war as soon as they kicked us out

356
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,070
赶到街上时就已经挑起战争了
of our new homes and onto the street.

357
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,480
世界各地都有人需要我  数百万的人
People around the world need me. Millions of them.

358
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,330
我不了解那几百万人  但我了解你
Right, I can't speak for millions, but I understand you.

359
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,940
我了解你的失望
I understand your frustration.

360
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,350
我了解你的无助
I understand your helplessness.

361
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,650
你想让我停手  因为有人受伤  对吗
So, you want me to stop because people are gettin' hurt, right?

362
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,380
但是  山姆  如果我在让这个世界变得更好呢
But, Sam, what if I'm making the world a better place?

363
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,310
不  如果你在杀人  这世界就没变好
No, it's not a better place if you're killin' people.

364
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,690
只是变得不一样了
It's just different.

365
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,400
真不知道你是聪明还是乐观到无可救药
You're either brilliant or just hopelessly optimistic.

366
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,680
-就不能两者皆是吗  -不能
- Well, can't I be a little bit of both? - No.

367
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,600
不不不  这是个糟糕的注意
No, no, no. This is a bad idea.

368
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,220
还没到十分钟  约翰  坐好了
It hasn't been ten minutes, John. Just sit tight.

369
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,960
别这样  别敷衍我
Don't do that. Don't patronize me.

370
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,680
他心里有数
He knows what he's doing.

371
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,610
我要进去
I'm goin' in.

372
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,650
这一切对你来说很轻松吧
This is all really easy for you, isn't it?

373
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,510
你体内流淌着那些血清
All that serum runnin' through your veins.

374
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,230
巴恩斯  你的搭档需要支援
Barnes, your partner needs backup in there.

375
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,360
你真的想让自己的双手沾上他的鲜血吗
Do you really want his blood on your hands?

376
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,730
我认识一个人
This guy I know,

377
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,370
他应该是全世界最了解超级士兵的人
who knows more about Super Soldiers than anyone else on the planet,

378
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,510
他说
he says...

379
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,170
你是至上主义者
you're a supremacist.

380
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,930
-我  -没错
- Me? - Yeah.

381
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,060
这太荒谬了
That's ridiculous.

382
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,060
我做的一切都是为了终结霸权
Everything I do is to end supremacy.

383
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,730
那些在背后操纵的公司和禽兽
These corporations and the beasts who run them,

384
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,840
才是至上主义者
they're the supremacists.

385
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,280
那我问你
So, let me ask you.

386
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,520
你还有更多血清  对吗
You have more serum, right?

387
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,630
那又怎么样
So?

388
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,000
你要扩充你的军队吗
Are you going to increase your army?

389
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,950
你在杀死无辜的人
You're killin' innocent people.

390
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,130
他们不无辜
They're not innocent.

391
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,080
他们是我路上的障碍
They're roadblocks in my journey

392
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,540
再让我选择我也会杀了他们
and I'd kill them again if I had to.

393
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,780
不  我不是这个意思
No, no. I didn't mean it like that.

394
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,870
-你引诱我说得好像...  -好像什么
- You tricked me into sounding like... - Like what?

395
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:10,920
我反抗的人们想抢走你的家  山姆
The people I'm fightin' are trying to take your home, Sam.

396
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,070
你为什么不阻止他们  反倒跑到这里
Why are you here instead of stopping them?

397
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,170
我姐姐也在等这个问题的答案
You know, my sister's waiting for that exact same answer.

398
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,470
我不是你的敌人
I'm not your enemy.

399
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,300
我肯定你做出的抗争
I agree with your fight.

400
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,660
但我只是无法赞同你反抗的方式
I just can't get with the way you're fightin' it.

401
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,400
我相信她也不会赞同
And I'm sure she wouldn't either.

402
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,280
卡莉·摩根索  你被捕了
Karli Morgenthau, you're under arrest.

403
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,580
-原来这才是你的目的  -不  等等
- So this is what that was? - No, wait...

404
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,220
-骗我  等增援  -聊得够久了
- Tricking me until help came? - We had enough time to talk.

405
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,320
-纳粹  -你给我...
- Nazi. - Why don't you...

406
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,240
该死
Shit.

407
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,320
我跟丢她了
I lost her.

408
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,840
这地方就是一个迷宫
This place is a maze.

409
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,410
这是我想的那样东西吗
Is this what I think it is?

410
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,060
不  不
No, no!

411
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,410
我们错过了什么
What did we miss?

412
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,360
你找到针剂了吗
Did you find the vials?

413
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,020
都被踩碎了
They've been destroyed.

414
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,220
我等了太久
I waited too long.

415
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,870
我们刚来到的时候
You know, when we first came together,

416
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,260
都被送到了同一区
I mean what were the chances that

417
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,130
是一件多么巧的事啊
we'd all be assigned to the same quarter?

418
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,670
我认识了原本不可能认识的人
To find people I would've never met,

419
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:45,010
如果在别的地方长大  可能会被教导去恨那些人
people I would've been taught to hate if I lived somewhere else?

420
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,720
我以为我们是...被选中的
I thought we'd been... chosen.

421
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,640
但现在  我只希望还能再多十来个伙伴
But now, I just wish there were a dozen more of us to fight.

422
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,580
我们还是比他们更加强大
We're still stronger than they are.

423
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,750
我们一起挑起了一切  也将这样结束
We started this together and that's how it'll end.

424
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,280
被他们这样紧盯着  我们什么也做不了
Can't function with them on our heels.

425
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,870
别无他法  必须先处理掉他们
There's no way around it. We gonna have to deal with them.

426
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,270
包括山姆·威尔逊
That includs Sam Wilson.

427
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,530
是...
It's...

428
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,140
是权力掮客
It's the Power Broker.

429
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,760
"你的革命所剩时间不多了  小姑娘
"You play revolutionary on borrowed time, little girl.

430
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,860
我要拿回我的血清
"I want the serum back or...

431
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:28,130
否则我会找到你  并了结你"
I will find you, and I will end you."

432
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,080
我们没法两面开战
We cannot fight two wars and win.

433
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,190
等到迫不得已的时候我会对付权力掮客
I'll deal with the Power Broker when the time comes.

434
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,930
我知道怎么兵不血刃地解决山姆
And I know how to deal with Sam without a direct fight.

435
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,150
是吗  那你说怎么办
Yeah? How do you propose we do that?

436
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,570
我们离间他们
We separate them.

437
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,270
然后杀死美国队长
And then we kill Captain America.

438
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,920
{\an8}莎伦
用你天上的眼睛盯紧沃克  如果他接近卡莉就通知我
山姆

439
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,330
有人提供过给你吗
Were you ever offered it?

440
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,140
什么
What?

441
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,750
-血清  -没有
- The serum. - No.

442
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,430
假设有
If you had been, hypothetically,

443
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:09,220
你会注射吗
that is, would you have taken it?

444
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,300
不会
No.

445
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,690
毫不犹豫  很不错
No hesitation. That's impressive.

446
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,550
山姆
Sam,

447
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,440
你不能再对卡莉抱有希望了
you can't hold out hope for Karli.

448
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,630
不管你看上了她什么
No matter what you saw in her,

449
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,480
她都无可救药了
she's gone.

450
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,620
我们不能让她和她的党羽
And we cannot allow that she and her acolytes

451
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,570
又在民众中造神
become yet another faction of gods amongst real people.

452
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:40,950
超级士兵就不该存在
Super Soldiers cannot be allowed to exist.

453
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,250
这些话不就是神的口吻吗
Isn't that how gods talk?

454
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:50,110
如果你真是这么想的  那巴基呢
And if that's how you feel, what about Bucky?

455
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,380
流血并不总能解决问题
Blood isn't always the solution.

456
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,580
沃克有点不对劲
Something's not right about Walker.

457
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,240
你发现了啊
You don't say.

458
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,270
我会分辨疯子
Well, I know a crazy when I see one.

459
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,030
因为我就是疯子
Because I am crazy.

460
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,570
有理有据
Can't argue with that.

461
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,300
你不该把盾给他的  
Shouldn't have given him the shield. 

462
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,120
我没有给他盾
I didn't give him the shield.

463
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,870
反正肯定不是史蒂夫给的
Well, Steve definitely didn't.

464
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,770
好了  够了  来吧
All right. That's it. Let's go.

465
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,320
我命令你们把他交出来
I'm now ordering you to turn him over.

466
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,540
慢点
Hey, slow your roll.

467
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,420
我们说清楚  不管有没有盾
Let's be clear, shield or no shield,

468
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,500
你在这里能管好的只有你的嘴巴
the only thing you're runnin' in here is your mouth.

469
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,530
我本来都劝住卡莉了  是你越界了
Now, I had Karli and you overstepped.

470
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,940
他今天反倒证明了自己有用
He's actually proven himself useful today.

471
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,670
我们需要齐心协力面对接下来的挑战
We'll need all hands on deck for whatever's comin' next.

472
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,440
那接下来你想用什么方式沟通  山姆
How do you want the rest of this conversation to go, Sam, huh?

473
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,440
是啊
Yeah.

474
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,420
我要放下盾吗  以示公平
Should I put down the shield? Make it fair?

475
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,210
{\an2}即使他是你们达到目的的手段

476
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,580
{\an2}时间也到了

477
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,380
立刻把他交给我们
Release him to us now.

478
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,590
你好  我是约翰·沃克  美国队长
Hi. John Walker. Captain America.

479
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,310
不如我们放下尖头棍子
Well, let's, uh, put down the pointy sticks 

480
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,920
好好谈一谈
and we can talk this through, huh?

481
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,810
约翰  别紧张
Hey, John, take it easy.

482
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,020
你哪怕跟巴基交手
You might wanna fight Bucky

483
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,220
也最好别招惹女子皇家护卫队
before you tangle with the Dora Milaje.

484
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,710
女子皇家护卫队在这没有管辖权
The Dora Milaje don't have jurisdiction here...

485
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,490
女子皇家护卫队
The Dora Milaje have jurisdiction

486
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:26,790
想在哪里有管辖权都行
wherever the Dora Milaje find themselves to be.

487
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:28,710
好吧
Okay.

488
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,960
听着  我们给彼此的第一印象不太好
Look, I think we got off on the wrong foot.

489
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,230
我们该插手
We should do something.

490
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,970
看着挺耐打啊  约翰
Looking strong, John.

491
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,870
巴基
Bucky...

492
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,430
阿由
Ayo.

493
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,170
阿由  我们先谈谈
Ayo, let's talk about this.

494
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,070
詹姆斯
James.

495
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,940
他走了  放下
He is gone. Leave it.

496
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,100
你知道她们会这一招吗
Did you know they could do that?

497
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,360
不知道
No.

498
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,240
你没事吧
You all right, man?

499
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,450
她们甚至都不是超级士兵
They weren't even Super Soldiers.

500
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,690
起来吧
Come on.

501
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,730
真不敢相信他效仿大毒枭越狱了
I can't believe he pulled an El Chapo.

502
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,170
我敢信
I can.

503
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,990
走吧
Come on.

504
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,620
听着
Look, man,

505
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,600
血清和其来源都不见了
the serum and its source are gone.

506
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,480
我知道事情的发展不如你所愿
I know it didn't work out the way you wanted it to,

507
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,060
但不全是坏事
but it ain't all bad.

508
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,760
约翰·沃克  能签个名吗
John Walker? Uh, would you mind?

509
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,720
可以  谢谢你
Uh, yeah. Hi. Thank you.

510
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,110
祝你今天愉快
Have a good day.

511
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,140
多久后你会厌烦做这些
How long till that gets really annoying?

512
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,650
你只是气她没问你要签名
You're mad she didn't ask for yours.

513
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,740
是她的损失
Oh, it's her loss.

514
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,550
我甚至给签名设计了一个战星标志
I even got a little Battlestar logo I draw with it.

515
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,830
如果你有机会注射血清  你会接受吗
If you had the chance to take the serum, would you?

516
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,550
当然
Hells, yeah.

517
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,020
你不担心血清会...
You wouldn't be worried about how it might...

518
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,620
改变你吗
How it might change you?

519
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,610
我认为
I mean...

520
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,960
能力只会放大一个人的本性  对吗
Power just makes a person more of themselves, right?

521
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,930
卡莉·摩根索
Karli Morgenthau.

522
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,510
史蒂夫·罗杰斯
Steve Rogers.

523
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,160
那我呢
And me?

524
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:22,180
你已经有三枚荣誉勋章了
You already have three Medals of Honor.

525
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,410
你始终能在激战中做出正确决定
You consistently make the right decisions in the heat of battle.

526
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:28,840
对
Yep.

527
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,580
三枚卓越奖章
Three badges of excellence

528
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,440
确保我永远不会忘记这辈子最糟的一天
to make sure I never forget the worst day of my life.

529
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,150
你和我心里清楚
We both know that the things

530
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:42,380
让我们获得勋章的  在阿富汗的所为
that we had to do in Afghanistan to be awarded those medals

531
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,220
远不能称之为正确
felt a long way from being right.

532
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,330
担任队长是我第一次
Being Cap is the first time

533
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:50,070
有机会做我觉得正确的事
I've had the chance to do something that actually feels right.

534
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,810
可是如果那天有血清
But God! Imagine how many lives

535
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,050
我们能挽救多少生命
we could have saved that day if we had that serum.

536
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,580
是啊
I know.

537
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:03,900
我知道
I know.

538
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,460
喂
Hello?

539
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,960
你是莎拉吗
Hello, is this Sarah?

540
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,580
是的  你是谁
Yeah. Who's this?

541
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,700
我叫卡莉·摩根索
My name is Karli Morgenthau.

542
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,050
我在新闻上见过你
I've seen you on the news.

543
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:27,300
你是碎旗者的领导者  那些恐怖分子  对吗
You're the leader of the Flag Smashers, those terrorists. Right?

544
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,660
是革命分子  取决于你站在谁那一边
Revolutionaries, depending on whose side you're on.

545
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,460
你打给我有什么原因吗
Is there a reason you're callin' me?

546
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,950
我在思考需不需要杀了你弟弟
I'm thinking if I need to kill your brother.

547
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,790
我本来以为我可以信任他
I thought I could trust him.

548
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,840
以为他和我有共同之处
I got the impression that he and I had some things in common,

549
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,250
结果发现他是你们新美国队长的手下
but then it turns out he's working for your new Captain America.

550
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,480
我没选择他
I didn't choose him.

551
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,210
不然你会选谁
Who would you have chosen instead?

552
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,520
我的世界对美国无关紧要
My world doesn't matter to America,

553
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,160
我何必在乎美国的吉祥物
so why should I care about its mascot?

554
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,860
我喜欢你  莎拉  你让我想起我自己
I like you, Sarah. You remind me of me.

555
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:59,490
卡莉  你最该相信的是这件事
Karli, if you believe one thing, believe this.

556
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:02,700
我弟弟不是那男人的手下
My brother is not working for that man.

557
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,370
希望你是对的
I hope you're right.

558
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,580
我需要和山姆单独见面
I need to meet with Sam. Alone.

559
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,110
我会发坐标给你转交给他
I'm sending you the coordinates to pass along.

560
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:10,950
为什么是我
Why me?

561
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,070
他得知道我是认真的
He needs to know that I'm serious.

562
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,020
我也得知道他不会再次背叛我的信任
And I need to know that he won't betray my trust again.

563
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,350
否则  不跟山姆在这见面的话
Otherwise, instead of meeting Sam here,

564
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:24,310
我总可以和你  AJ和小凯斯在你那边见面
I can always meet with you, and AJ, and little Cass there,

565
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:29,090
也许在屋后面的码头旁边
maybe out back, by the dock?

566
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:41,890
她说什么
She said what?

567
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,470
好  等一下  别急  我知道
Right. Hold on, hold on. I know, I know.

568
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,850
听着  打包点行李  带孩子们离开
Listen, pack an overnight bag and take the boys.

569
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,850
出什么事了
What happened?

570
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,020
卡莉打给莎拉了  她威胁我的外甥们
Karli called Sarah. She threatened my nephews.

571
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:58,260
去安全的地方  只付现金  知道吗
Okay. Go somewhere safe. Only pay cash. All right?

572
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,500
到达目的地告诉我
Let me know when you get there.

573
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,610
我知道  我爱你
I know. Look, I love you.

574
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,520
我绝不会让你和孩子们出事的
I'll never let anything happen to you and the boys.

575
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,020
好  再见
Okay. Bye.

576
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,650
卡莉想见面  她留下了联络号码
Karli wants to meet. She left a contact number.

577
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,180
{\an8}现在来北广场屋顶  一个人来

578
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,370
她叫我一个人去
She said come alone.

579
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,110
我和你一起去
I'm coming with you.

580
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,170
卡莉
Karli!

581
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,140
你居然打给我姐姐  我们要这么玩吗
You called my sister? That's how we're gonna play this?

582
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,960
山姆  我绝不会伤害她  我只想更了解你
Sam, I would never hurt her. I just wanted to understand you better.

583
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,960
你不是一个人来的
I see you, um, didn't come alone.

584
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,310
你必须立刻结束这一切
You have to end this now.

585
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,630
我不想伤害你
I don't wanna hurt you.

586
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,860
你只是我想摧毁的政权的工具
You're a tool in the regimes I want to destroy.

587
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,460
你没躲在盾后面
You're not hiding behind a shield.

588
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,750
我杀了你  只会毫无意义
If I were to kill you, it'd be meaningless.

589
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,090
我本来打算叫你加入我
I was gonna ask you to join me.

590
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:10,100
或是帮世界一个忙  放我走
Or do the world a favor and let me go.

591
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,850
{\an8}追踪器01

592
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,550
你好啊  约翰·沃克
Hello, John Walker.

593
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,330
山姆  新队长在移动
Hey, Sam, new Cap is moving,

594
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,670
看样子他找到他们了  或是被他们找到了
looks like he's found them, or maybe they found him.

595
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,410
是沃克
It's Walker.

596
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,770
我把位置发给你  快走
I'll send you the location. Go!

597
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:10,310
莱玛  莱玛
Lemar... Lemar!

598
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,320
把他绑起来
Tie him up.

599
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,350
糟了
Oh, shit.

600
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,360
-你做了什么  -莱玛在他们手上
- What'd you do? - They've got Lemar.

601
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,200
乖乖待在这
Stay there.

602
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,690
怎么那么喜欢用刀
What's with all the knives?

603
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:04,840
不用谢
You're welcome.

604
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,260
莱玛  莱玛
Lemar. Lemar.

605
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:29,290
她在哪
Where is she?

606
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,870
不是我干的
It wasn't me!

607
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:39,840
不是我干的
It wasn't me!
